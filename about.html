		text-indent: 50px;">Hey! My name is Michael Adrian F. Ablang, the author, and maker of this website. I am a Grade 9 student at
		Philippine Science High School - Central Luzon Campus and my section is currently Arayat. What my website shows today is an essay with a topic of
		poverty and how to solve it. The main twist here is I made it satirical and not fully serious. This makes the poem more interesting as it shows obvious
		“fake solutions” to poverty but in the end, I did add some solutions to it.</p>
		
	<p style=
		"text-align: left;
		font-size: 2vw;
		font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
		text-indent: 50px;">The motivation behind my poem is how I sometimes feel about rich people becoming richer and poor people becoming even poorer.
		Don’t get me wrong, there are plenty of rich people who do good deeds but they are some who can ruin your day in a matter of seconds. The fake solution
		I gave was that we should eat the rich people in the world. It does sound very disturbing and indifferent but it’s just a play on sarcasm. The real solution
		I did put in is raising the minimum wage, supporting pay equity, and provide paid leave and sick days. This would help people suffering from poverty as they get
		stressed a lot because of their situation and the fact that they never get any rest.</p>
