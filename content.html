		text-indent: 50px;">Poverty is one of the running social issues that plenty of people suffer from. It is a state or condition
		in which a person or community lacks the financial resources and essentials for a minimum standard of
		living. We still haven’t found a solution to this problem but this essay will show you how not to prevent it
		and how to solve it.</p>
		
	<p style=
		"text-align: left;
		font-size: 2vw;
		font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
		text-indent: 50px;">A satirical solution to this eating the rich people in the world. This world would become less
		populated and as a bonus, we can get their money and still be full from what we ate. The rich won’t be
		important anyways and because of this cycle, we would also get eaten by the following poor people, thus,
		making a full cycle of endless richness.</p>
		
	<p style=
		"text-align: left;
		font-size: 2vw;
		font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
		text-indent: 50px;">We can preserve our population with this solution and we wouldn’t even complain because of the
		feast we are having eating the rich! This was the solution needed to stop poverty decades ago but we were
		too scared to implement it. Hindsight is 2020 and everything is going well! There is no virus stopping us and
		everyone is outside enjoying themselves but we still find ourselves stuck with a problem in poverty. This is
		why we should implement it now rather than in the future because there isn’t any other problems in our
		world.</p>
		
	<p style=
		"text-align: left;
		font-size: 2vw;
		font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
		text-indent: 50px;">Poverty is just a minor issue in this world that needs to be solved before it becomes a big issue in
		our lives. We would all benefit from eating the rich and the rich would be able to do something important in
		their lives besides being rich. This is the only solution to poverty and we should be ready for this to happen
		soon enough.</p>
		
	<p style=
		"text-align: left;
		font-size: 2vw;
		font-family: 'Lato', sans-serif;
		text-indent: 50px;">In the end, if we are really looking for solutions to poverty, one solution is raising the minimum
		wage. We had a high minimum wage before but due to the rising economy, it wouldn’t even be enough for
		a family. Another solution is supporting the pay equity. We still generalize and stereotype women as
		weak and only for limited jobs but if we support the pay equity we can close the gender wage gap and
		would help women in poverty easily get jobs. The last of many solutions I will mention in this essay is to
		provide paid leave and paid sick days. People with stressful jobs and are struggling with their lives don’t get
		money when they take a break so they limit their breaks as much as possible so they could get more
		money. This would help people relax but still be able to have a stable job.</p>
